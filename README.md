# Segmentation-
This project compares four image segmentation methods: User Threshold, Otsu, Fuzzy, and the robust U-Net deep learning model. U-Net, implemented in PyTorch, is trained on annotated data and uses balanced loss. Evaluation confirms that U-Net is significantly more accurate and robust than classical methods on real-world images.
